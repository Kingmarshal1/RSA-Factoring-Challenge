RSA Factoring Challenge

Created by Chukwudike Igwe

Task 1: Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

Task 2: The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

p and q are always prime numbers
There is only one number in the files
How far can you go in less than 5 seconds?
